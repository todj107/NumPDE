## How to use Github:

### Setup:
1) Ensure that you have a ssh key (Ask GPT).
2) Clone repo from: https://github.com/todj107/NumPDE
3) Ask for permission (Tor is the only one that can give that).

### When you have done changes:
1) *git add .* // Add everything in your folder
2) *git commit -m "Some message about your changes"*
3) *git pull* // Need to pull the new version on git
4) *git push* // Push your changes to git

### Trubles:
1) Never change the same file as another person. Git conflicts sucks.
2) If the terminal asks about your name or email. Read what it says and do that.
3) If the terminal askes if you want *rebase* or *no rebase* choose *rebase*

## Instaling correct packages:

### Instal python (if not already installed)
*sudo apt install python3-full python3-venv*

### Create enviroment and source it:
*python3 -m venv .venv*
*source .venv/bin/activate*

### Download the requirements:
*pip install -r requirements.txt*
